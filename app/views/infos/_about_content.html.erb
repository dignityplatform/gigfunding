     <p class="info1">Gigfunding was born from the frustration with traditional fundraising. We are fed up with  guilt-trippin’ chuggers, manipulative cold calls, passive direct debits, and sponsored flippin’ bungee jumps.</p>
      <p class="info2">We have updated fundraising, by creating a way that’s sustainable, social, and actually useful. No matter your skills, ability, or availability, you can give how you want to.</p>
        <p class="info11">Think of it as <span><em>useful</em> sponsored tasks.</span></p>
          <p class="info3">2020 certainly reminded us all what’s most important. No, not loo roll, our social connections, silly. We’re tackling loneliness by bringing people together, connecting over the common cause of social change.</p>
            <p class="info11">So enough talking about change, let’s start <span><strong>doing it.</strong></span></p>

      <p class="info5">Old friends and co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pasco/">Pasco</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukeflegg/">Luke</a> began collaborating on the idea of Gigfunding remotely, whilst Pasco was living in Mexico. They’d previously worked on an online democracy project together, so were no strangers to thinking outside the box.</p>

      <p class="info6">Pasco returned to the UK in the summer and Gigfunding made its simple beginnings as a humble whiteboard in sunny Brighton, with polaroids for profile pictures and post-it notes for listings. We also registered as a non-profit.</p>

      <p class="info7">We began to have an online presence, testing the concept using a hacked-Wix website. At this time the project was called <em>‘Dignity platform’</em>, and here the seeds were being sewn for Gigfunding to grow.</p>

      <p class="info9">Well, what a year. It hit many of us in many different ways. Thankfully, Gigfunding benefited from the altruistic nature of people with more time on their hands. Led by Pasco, our team of volunteers grew from 3 to 25, we landed our first major charity partnership <em>and</em> we launched our first proper website!</p>
